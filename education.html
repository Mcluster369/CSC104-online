        <h1>Educational Users: Drones for Education</h1>
        <p>Drones are increasingly being used in education for a variety of purposes. They can be used in mathematics, arts, physical education, and language. Here are some ways drones are being used for educational purposes: 

            Curriculum Integration: Drones can be integrated into the curriculum to teach various subjects. For example, they can be used in mathematics to teach concepts like distance, speed, and time. 
            
            Coding and Programming: Some drones come with software development kits (SDKs) that allow students to learn coding and programming. For example, the DJI Tello EDU drone and the Robolink CoDrone Lite & Pro educational kit are designed around STEAM learning principles and come with programs to learn how to code and build each UAV. 
            
            Hands-On Learning:  Building and operating drones provide students with hands-on learning experiences. This can help students understand complex concepts more easily. 
            
            Career Preparation:The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a program called the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Collegiate Training Initiative (UAS-CTI) designed for universities, colleges, and technical schools. This program prepares students for careers in UAS or drones. 
            
            Research:  Drones can also be used for research purposes in higher education institutions. 
            
            Remember, if you're a teacher or a student looking to bring drones into your curriculum, its important to know the rules and regulations related to drone operations set by the FAA.

            <h2>Drone Technology</h2>
            <p>Drone technology refers to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are aircraft that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through pre-programmed flight plans. Drones can range in size from tiny devices that fit in the palm of your hand to large military drones capable of carrying heavy payloads. 
       Drones, sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), carry out tasks that range from the mundane to the ultra-dangerous. These robot-like aircrafts can be found rescuing avalanche victims as well as dropping off groceries at your doorstep — and almost everywhere in between. 
                
                A drones autonomy level can range from remotely piloted (a human controls its movements) to advanced autonomy, which means that it relies on a system of sensors and LiDAR detectors to calculate its movement. Different drones are capable of traveling varying heights and distances. 
                
                Sectors like videography, search and rescue, agriculture, and transportation have adopted drone technology. Originally developed for the military and aerospace industries, drones have found their way into the mainstream because of the enhanced levels of safety and efficiency they bring. 
                
                In addition to the software, autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them to carry out their missions without human intervention, such as cloud computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and thermal sensors.

            <h2>Regulations</h2>

            <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has set rules for drone operations in the United States. Here are some key points: 

            Registration: All drones requiring registration or drones that have been registered, including those flown for fun, for business, or for public safety, must be operated in accordance with the Remote ID rule. Anyone flying under Part 107 has to register each drone they intend to operate. 
            
            Operating Requirements: Drones should always avoid manned aircraft and never operate in a careless or reckless manner. The drone should be kept within sight at all times. 
            
            Flight Restrictions: Drones can fly during daylight (30 minutes before official sunrise to 30 minutes after official sunset, local time) or in twilight if the drone has anti-collision lighting. The maximum allowable altitude is 400 feet above the ground, higher if your drone remains within 400 feet of a structure. 
            
            Pilot Certification: To operate the controls of a drone under Part 107, you need a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating, or be under the direct supervision of a person who holds such a certificate. 
            
            Recreational Use: If you want to fly a drone for purely recreational purposes, there is a limited statutory exception (“carve out”) that provides a basic set of requirements. 
            
            Remember, these are just some of the regulations. For more detailed information, you should visit the FAAs website or consult with an expert.</p>
